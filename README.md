# Simple-Linear-Regression-Closed-Form-Solution-

**Simple Linear Regression from Scratch**  
This repository contains an implementation of Simple Linear Regression without using libraries like `sklearn`. The model is built using Python and NumPy, demonstrating how to compute the slope and intercept manually.  

#### **Key Features**:
- Custom regression class (`MeralR`) for training and prediction.  
- Dataset handling using Pandas.  
- Train-test split for model evaluation.  
- Step-by-step approach to understand regression fundamentals.
